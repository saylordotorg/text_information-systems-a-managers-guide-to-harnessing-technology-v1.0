    <p class="para editable block" id="gallaugher-ch06_s02_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Blogs</a><span class="glossdef">Online journal entries, usually made in a reverse chronological order. Blogs typically provide comment mechanisms where users can post feedback for authors and other readers.</span></span> (short for Web logs) first emerged almost a decade ago as a medium for posting online diaries. (In a perhaps apocryphal story, <em class="emphasis">Wired</em> magazine claimed the term “Web log” was coined by Jorn Barger, a sometimes homeless, yet profoundly prolific, Internet poster). From humble beginnings, the blogging phenomenon has grown to a point where the number of public blogs tracked by Technorati (the popular blog index) has surpassed one hundred million.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-gallaugher-fn06_009">D. Takahashi, “Technorati Releases Data on State of the Blogosphere: Bloggers of the World Have United,” <em class="emphasis">VentureBeat</em>, September 28, 2008.</span> This number is clearly a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">long tail</a><span class="glossdef">In this context, refers to an extremely large selection of content or products. The long tail is a phenomenon whereby firms can make money by offering a near-limitless selection.</span></span> phenomenon, loaded with niche content that remains “discoverable” through search engines and blog indexes. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Trackbacks</a><span class="glossdef">Links in a blog post that refer eaders back to cited sources. Trackbacks allow a blogger to see which and how many other bloggers are referring to their content. A “trackback” field is supported by most blog software and while it’s not required to enter a trackback when citing another post, it’s considered good “netiquette” to do so.</span></span> (third-party links back to original blog post), and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">blog rolls</a><span class="glossdef">A list of a blogger’s favorite blogs. While not all blogs include blog rolls, those that do are often displayed on the right or left column of a blog’s main page.</span></span> (a list of a blogger’s favorite sites—a sort of shout-out to blogging peers) also help distinguish and reinforce the reputation of widely read blogs.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gallaugher-ch06_s02_p03">The most popular blogs offer cutting-edge news and commentary, with postings running the gamut from professional publications to personal diaries. While this cacophony of content was once dismissed, blogging is now a respected and influential medium. Consider that the political blog The Huffington Post is now more popular than all but eight newspaper sites and has a valuation higher than many publicly traded papers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-gallaugher-fn06_010">E. Alterman, “Out of Print, the Death and Life of the American Newspaper,” <em class="emphasis">New Yorker</em>, March 31, 2008; and M. Learmonth, “Huffington Post More Valuable Than Some Newspaper Cos.,” <em class="emphasis">DigitalNext</em>, December 1, 2008.</span> Keep in mind that this is a site without the sports, local news, weather, and other content offered by most papers. Ratings like this are hard to achieve—most bloggers can’t make a living off their musings. But among the elite ranks, killer subscriber numbers are a magnet for advertisers. Top blogs operating on shoestring budgets can snare several hundred thousand dollars a month in ad revenue.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-gallaugher-fn06_011">S. Zuckerman, “Yes, Some Blogs Are Profitable—Very Profitable,” <em class="emphasis">San Francisco Chronicle</em>, October 21, 2007.</span> Most start with ad networks like Google AdSense, but the most elite engage advertisers directly for high-value deals and extended sponsorships.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gallaugher-ch06_s02_p04">Top blogs have begun to attract well-known journalists away from print media. The Huffington Post hired a former <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em> editor Lawrence Roberts to head the site’s investigative unit. The popular blog TechCrunch hired Erick Schonfeld away from Time Warner’s business publishing empire, while Schonfeld’s cohort Om Malik founded another highly ranked tech industry blog, GigaOM. And sometimes this drift flows the other direction. Robert Scoble, a blogger who made his reputation as the informal online voice for Microsoft, was hired to run social media at <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em> magazine.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gallaugher-ch06_s02_p05">Senior executives from many industries have also begun to weigh in with online ruminations, going directly to the people without a journalist filtering their comments. Sun Microsystem’s Jonathan Schwartz, GM’s Bob Lutz, and Paul Levy (CEO of healthcare quality leader Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center) use their blogs for purposes that include a combination of marketing, sharing ideas, gathering feedback, press response, and image shaping. Blogs have the luxury of being more topically focused than traditional media, with no limits on page size, word count, or publication deadline. Some of the best examples engage new developments in topic domains much more quickly and deeply than traditional media. For example, it’s not uncommon for blogs focused on the law or politics to provide a detailed dissection of a Supreme Court opinion within hours of its release—offering analysis well ahead of, and with greater depth, than via what bloggers call the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mainstream media (MSM)</a><span class="glossdef">Refers to newspapers, magazine, television, and radio. The MSM is distinctly different from Internet media such as blogs.</span></span>. As such, it’s not surprising that most mainstream news outlets have begun supplementing their content with blogs that can offer greater depth, more detail, and deadline-free timeliness.</p>
    <div class="callout editable block" id="gallaugher-ch06_s02_n02">
        <h3 class="title">Blogs</h3>
        <p class="para" id="gallaugher-ch06_s02_p06">While the feature set of a particular blog depends on the underlying platform and the preferences of the blogger, several key features are common to most blogs:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="gallaugher-ch06_s02_l02">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Ease of use</em>. Creating a new post usually involves clicking a single button.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Reverse chronology</em>. Posts are listed in reverse order of creation, making it easy to see the most recent content.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Comment threads</em>. Readers can offer comments on posts.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Persistence</em>. Posts are maintained indefinitely at locations accessible by permanent links.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Searchability</em>. Current and archived posts are easily searchable.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Tags</em>. Posts are often classified under an organized tagging scheme.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Trackbacks</em>. Allows an author to acknowledge the source of an item in their post, which allows bloggers to follow the popularity of their posts among other bloggers.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gallaugher-ch06_s02_p07">The voice of the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">blogosphere</a><span class="glossdef">A term referring to the collective community of bloggers, as well as those who read and comment on blogs.</span></span> can wield significant influence. Examples include leading the charge for Dan Rather’s resignation and prompting the design of a new insulin pump. In an example of what can happen when a firm ignores social media, consider the flare-up Ingersoll Rand faced when the online community exposed a design flaw in its Kryptonite bike lock.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gallaugher-ch06_s02_p08">Online posts showed the thick metal lock could be broken with a simple ball-point pen. A video showing the hack was posted online. When Ingersoll Rand failed to react quickly, the blogosphere erupted with criticism. Just days after online reports appeared, the mainstream media picked up the story. The <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> ran a story titled “The Pen Is Mightier Than the Lock” that included a series of photos demonstrating the ballpoint Kryptonite lock pick. The event tarnished the once-strong brand and eventually resulted in a loss of over ten million dollars.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gallaugher-ch06_s02_p09">Concern over managing a firm’s online reputation by monitoring blog posts and other social media commentary has led to the rise of an industry known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">online reputation management</a><span class="glossdef">The process of tracking and responding to online mentions of a product, organization, or individual. Services supporting online reputation management range from free Google Alerts to more sophisticated services that blend computer-based and human monitoring of multiple media channels.</span></span>. Firms specializing in this field will track a client firm’s name, brand, executive names, or other keywords and report online activity and whether it is positive or negative</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gallaugher-ch06_s02_p10">Like any Web page, blogs can be public, tucked behind a corporate firewall, or password protected. Most blogs offer a two-way dialog, allowing users to comment on posts (sort of instant “letters to the editor,” posted online and delivered directly to the author). The running dialog can read like an electronic bulletin board, and can be an effective way to gather opinion when vetting ideas. Just as important, user comments help keep a blogger honest. Just as the “wisdom of crowds” keeps Wikipedia accurate, a vigorous community of commenters will quickly expose a blogger’s errors of fact or logic.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gallaugher-ch06_s02_p11">Despite this increased popularity, blogging has its downside. Blog comments can be a hothouse for spam and the disgruntled. Ham-handed corporate efforts (such as poor response to public criticism or bogus “praise posts”) have been ridiculed. Employee blogging can be difficult to control and public postings can “live” forever in the bowels of an Internet search engine or as content pasted on other Web sites. Many firms have employee blogging and broader Internet posting policies to guide online conduct that may be linked to the firm. Bloggers beware—there are dozens of examples of workers who have been fired for what employers viewed as inappropriate posts.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gallaugher-ch06_s02_p12">Blogs can be hosted via third-party services (Google Blogger, WordPress.com, TypePad, Windows Live Spaces), with most offering a combination of free and premium features. Blogging features have also been incorporated into social networks such as Facebook, MySpace, and Ning, as well as wiki tools such as SocialText. Blogging software can also be run on third-party servers, allowing the developer more control in areas such as security and formatting. The most popular platform for users choosing to host their own blog server is the open source Word Press system (based on PHP and MySQL).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gallaugher-ch06_s02_p13">Blogs have become a fire hose of rapidly delivered information as tool providers have made it easier for would-be bloggers to capture and post content. For example, the Google Toolbar has a “BlogThis!” feature that allows anyone with a Google Blogger account to post links directly to their blogs. Apple ships blog hosting tools with its server products, and Microsoft offers the free LiveWriter blog editing tool and the Windows Spaces blogging service. Blogger and many social networking sites also offer easy features for posting content and photos from a mobile phone or devices like the iPod Touch.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gallaugher-ch06_s02_p14">In the end, the value of any particular blog derives from a combination of technical and social features. The technical features make it easy for a blogger and his or her community to engage in an ongoing conversation on some topic of shared interest. But the social norms and patterns of use that emerge over time in each blog are what determine whether technology features will be harnessed for good or ill. Some blogs develop norms of fairness, accuracy, proper attribution, quality writing, and good faith argumentation, and attract readers that find these norms attractive. Others mix it up with hotly contested debate, one-sided partisanship, or deliberately provocative posts, attracting a decidedly different type of discourse.</p>
