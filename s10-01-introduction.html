    <p class="para editable block" id="gallaugher-ch06_s01_p02">Over the past few years a fundamentally different class of Internet services has attracted users, made headlines, and increasingly garnered breathtaking market valuations. Often referred to under the umbrella term “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Web 2.0</a><span class="glossdef">A term broadly referring to Internet services that foster collaboration and information sharing; characteristics that distinctly set “Web 2.0” efforts apart from the static, transaction-oriented Web sites of “Web 1.0.” The term is often applied to Web sites and Internet services that foster social media or other sorts of peer production.</span></span>,” these new services are targeted at harnessing the power of the Internet to empower users to collaborate, create resources, and share information in a distinctly different way from the static Web sites and transaction-focused storefronts that characterized so many failures in the dot-com bubble. Blogs, wikis, social networks, photo and video sharing sites, and tagging systems all fall under the Web 2.0 moniker, as do a host of supporting technologies and related efforts.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gallaugher-ch06_s01_p03">The term Web 2.0 is a tricky one because like so many popular technology terms there’s not a precise definition. Coined by publisher and pundit Tim O’Reilly in 2003, techies often joust over the breadth of the Web 2.0 umbrella and over whether Web 2.0 is something new or simply an extension of technologies that have existed since the creation of the Internet. These arguments aren’t really all that important. What is significant is how quickly the Web 2.0 revolution came about, how unexpected it was, and how deeply impactful these efforts have become. Some of the sites and services that have evolved and their Web 1.0 origins are listed in <a class="xref" href="#gallaugher-ch06_s01_t01">Table 6.1 "Web 1.0 versus Web 2.0"</a>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-gallaugher-fn06_001">Adapted from T.

    <p class="para editable block" id="gallaugher-ch06_s01_p04">To underscore the speed with which Web 2.0 arrived on the scene, and the impact of leading Web 2.0 services, consider the following efforts:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="gallaugher-ch06_s01_l02">
        <li>According to a spring 2008 report by Morgan Stanley, Web 2.0 services ranked as seven of the world’s top ten most heavily trafficked Internet sites (YouTube, Live.com, MySpace, Facebook, Hi5, Wikipedia, and Orkut); only one of these sites (MySpace) was on the list in 2005.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-gallaugher-fn06_002">Morgan Stanley, <em class="emphasis">Internet Trends Report</em>, March 2008.</span>
</li>
        <li>With only seven full-time employees and an operating budget of less than one million dollars, Wikipedia has become the Internet’s fifth most visited site on the Internet.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-gallaugher-fn06_003">G. Kane and R. Fichman, “The Shoemaker’s Children: Using Wikis for Information Systems Teaching, Research, and Publication,” <em class="emphasis">MIS Quarterly</em>, March 2009.</span> The site boasts well over fourteen million articles in over two hundred sixty different languages, all of them contributed, edited, and fact-checked by volunteers.</li>
        <li>Just two years after it was founded, MySpace was bought for $580 million by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation (the media giant that owns the <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em> and the Fox networks, among other properties). By the end of 2007, the site accounted for some 12 percent of Internet minutes and has repeatedly ranked as the most-visited Web site in the United States.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-gallaugher-fn06_004">D. Chmielewski and J. Guynn, “MySpace Ready to Prove Itself in Faceoff,” <em class="emphasis">Chicago Tribune</em>, June 8, 2008.</span>
</li>
        <li>At rival Facebook, users in the highly sought after college demographic spend over thirty minutes a day on the site. A fall 2007 investment from Microsoft pegged the firm’s overall value at fifteen billion dollars, a number that would make it the fifth most valuable Internet firm, despite annual revenues at the time of only one hundred fifty million dollars.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-gallaugher-fn06_005">M. Arrington, “Perspective: Facebook Is Now Fifth Most Valuable U.S. Internet Company,” <em class="emphasis">TechCrunch</em>, October 25, 2007.</span>
</li>
        <li>Just twenty months after its founding, YouTube was purchased by Google for $1.65 billion. While Google struggles to figure out how to make profitable what is currently a money-losing resource hog (over twenty hours of video are uploaded to YouTube each minute)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-gallaugher-fn06_006">E. Nakashima, “YouTube Ordered to Release User Data,” <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>, July 4, 2008.</span> the site has emerged as the Web’s leading destination for video, hosting everything from apologies from JetBlue’s CEO for service gaffes to questions submitted as part of the 2008 U.S. presidential debates. Fifty percent of YouTube’s roughly three hundred million users visit the site at least once a week.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-gallaugher-fn06_007">Morgan Stanley, <em class="emphasis">Internet Trends Report</em>, March 2008.</span>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gallaugher-ch06_s01_p05">Millions of users, billions of dollars, huge social impact, and these efforts weren’t even on the radar of most business professionals when today’s graduating college seniors first enrolled as freshmen. The trend demonstrates that even some of the world’s preeminent thought leaders and business publications can be sideswiped by the speed of the Internet.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="gallaugher-ch06_s01_p06">Consider that when management guru Michael Porter wrote a piece titled, “Strategy and the Internet” at the end of the dot-com bubble, he lamented the high cost of building brand online, questioned the power of network effects, and cast a skeptical eye on ad-supported revenue models. Well, it turns out Web 2.0 efforts challenged <em class="emphasis">all</em> of these assumptions. Among the efforts above, all built brand on the cheap with little conventional advertising, and each owes their hypergrowth and high valuation to their ability to harness the network effect. In June, 2008, <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em> also confessed to having an eye off the ball. In a cover story on social media, the magazine offered a mea culpa, confessing that while blogging was on their radar, editors were blind to the bigger trends afoot online, and underestimated the rise and influence of social networks, wikis, and other efforts.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-gallaugher-fn06_008">Stephen Baker and Heather Green, “Beyond Blogs: What Every Business Needs to Know,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, June 2, 2008.</span></p>

Web-based efforts that foster peer production are often referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">social media</a><span class="glossdef">Content that is created, shared, and commented on by a broader community of users. Services that support the production and sharing of social media include blogs, wikis, video sites like YouTube, and most social networks.</span></span> or <em class="emphasis">user-generated content</em> sites. These sites include blogs; wikis; social networks like Facebook and MySpace; communal bookmarking and tagging sites like Del.icio.us; media sharing sites like YouTube and Flickr; and a host of supporting technologies. And it’s not just about media. Peer-produced services like Skype and BitTorrent leverage users’ computers instead of a central IT resource to forward phone calls and video. This ability saves their sponsors the substantial cost of servers, storage, and bandwidth. Techniques such as crowdsourcing, where initially undefined groups of users band together to solve problems, create code, and develop services, are also a type of peer production. These efforts will be expanded on below, along with several examples of their use and impact.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="gallaugher-ch06_s01_l16">
            <li>A new generation of Internet applications is enabling consumers to participate in creating content and services online. Examples include Web 2.0 efforts such as social networks, blogs, and wikis, as well as efforts such as Skype and BitTorret, which leverage the collective hardware of their user communities to provide a service.</li>
            <li>These efforts have grown rapidly, most with remarkably little investment in promotion. Nearly all of these new efforts leverage network effects to add value and establish their dominance and viral marketing to build awareness and attract users.</li>
            <li>Experts often argue whether Web 2.0 is something new or merely an extension of existing technologies. The bottom line is the magnitude of the impact of the current generation of services.</li>
            <li>Network effects play a leading role in enabling Web 2.0 firms. Many of these services also rely on ad-supported revenue models.</li>
