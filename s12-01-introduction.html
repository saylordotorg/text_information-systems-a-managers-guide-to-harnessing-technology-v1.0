    <p class="para editable block" id="gallaugher-ch08_s01_p02">Google has been called a one-trick pony,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-gallaugher-fn08_001">C. Li, “Why Google’s One-Trick Pony Struggles to Learn New Tricks,” <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Publishing</em>, May 2009.</span> but as tricks go, it’s got an exquisite one. Google’s “trick” is matchmaking—pairing Internet surfers with advertisers and taking a cut along the way. This cut is substantial—over twenty-one billion dollars in 2008. In fact, as <em class="emphasis">Wired</em>’s Steve Levy puts it, Google’s matchmaking capabilities may represent “the most successful business idea in history.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-gallaugher-fn08_002">S. Levy, “The Secrets of Googlenomics,” <em class="emphasis">Wired</em>, June 2009.</span> For perspective, consider that as a ten-year-old firm, and one that had been public for less than five years, Google had already grown to earn more annual advertising dollars than <em class="emphasis">any</em> U.S. media company. No television network, no magazine group, no newspaper chain brings in more ad bucks than Google. And none is more profitable. While Google’s stated mission is “to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful,” advertising drives profits and lets the firm offer most of its services for free.</p>

Not bad for a business started by two twenty-something computer science graduate students.

        <h3 class="title">Genius Geeks and Plum Perks</h3>
        <p class="para" id="gallaugher-ch08_s01_p05">Brin and Page have built a talent magnet. At the Googleplex, the firm’s Mountain View, California headquarters, geeks are lavished with perks that include on-site laundry, massage, carwash, bicycle repair, free haircuts, state of the art gyms, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">wi-fi</a><span class="glossdef">Wireless technologies linking base stations (or hotspots) with devices containing wi-fi chips. Most hotspots have a range of 100 to 300 feet.</span></span> equipped shuttles that ferry employees between Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Bay area. The Googleplex is also pretty green. The facility gets 30 percent of its energy from solar cells, representing the largest corporate installation of its kind.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-gallaugher-fn08_009">D. Weldon, “Google’s Power Play,” <em class="emphasis">EnergyDigital</em>, August 30, 2007.</span></p>
        <p class="para" id="gallaugher-ch08_s01_p06">The firm’s quirky tech-centric culture is evident everywhere. A T-Rex skeleton looms near the volleyball court. Hanging from the lobby ceiling is a replica of SpaceShipOne, the first commercial space vehicle. And visitors to the bathroom will find “testing on the toilet,” coding problems or other brainteasers to keep gray matter humming while seated on one of the firm’s $800 remote-controlled Japanese commodes. Staff also enjoy an A-list lecture series attracting luminaries ranging from celebrities to heads of state.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gallaugher-ch08_s01_p07">And of course there’s the food—all of it free. The firm’s founders felt that no employee should be more than 100 feet away from nourishment, and a tour around Google offices will find espresso bars, snack nooks, and fully stocked beverage refrigerators galore. There are eleven gourmet cafeterias on site, the most famous being “Charlie’s Place,” first run by the former executive chef for the Grateful Dead.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gallaugher-ch08_s01_p08">CEO Eric Schmidt says the goal of all this is “to strip away everything that gets in our employees’ way.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-gallaugher-fn08_010">L. Wolgemuth, “Forget the Recession, I Want a Better Chair,” <em class="emphasis">U.S. News and World Report</em>, April 28, 2008.</span> And the perks, culture, and sense of mission have allowed the firm to assemble one of the most impressive rosters of technical talent anywhere. The Googleplex is like a well-fed Manhattan project, and employee ranks have included “Father of the Internet” Vint Cerf; Hal Varian, the former Dean of the U.C. Berkeley School of Information Management and Systems; Kai-Fu Lee, the former head of Microsoft Research in China; and Andy Hertzfeld, one of the developers of the original Macintosh user interface.</p>
        <p class="para" id="gallaugher-ch08_s01_p09">Engineers find Google a particularly attractive place to work, in part due to a corporate policy of offering “20 percent time,” the ability work the equivalent of one day a week on new projects that interest them. It’s a policy that has fueled innovation. Google Vice President Marissa Mayer (who herself regularly ranks among <em class="emphasis">Fortune</em>’s most powerful women in business) has stated that roughly half of Google products got their start in 20 percent time.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-gallaugher-fn08_011">B. Casnocha, “Success on the Side,” <em class="emphasis">The American: The Journal of the American Enterprise Institute</em>, April 24, 2009.</span></p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="gallaugher-ch08_s01_p10">Studying Google gives us an idea of how quickly technology-fueled market disruptions can happen, and how deeply these disruptions penetrate various industries. We’ll also study the underlying technologies that power search, online advertising, and customer profiling. We’ll explore issues of strategy, privacy, fraud, and discuss other opportunities and challenges the firm faces going forward.</p>
